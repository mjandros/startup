## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - done
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - inshallah it is compelling
- [x] Description of key features - listed the main points of the application's functionality

### Elevator pitch

Before the invention of the internet, before both world wars, before the Gilded Age, the Louisiana Purchase, the French Revolution, and the birth of America, the card game Vingt-et-un was created in France. The game has persisted over the last three centuries, coming to be known as Twenty-one to English-speaking audiences, and later as Blackjack. This application simulates the high-stakes casino classic with fake cash, and allows players to compete for the highest total winnings.
